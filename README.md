Welcome to PSLE-Math.com

This is the demo code of how PSLE Math questions are generated.

Using computer server, we can generate unlimited number of questions for each type of questions.

For example, for solution of a system of 2 linear equations, we can have a set of generic solutions first, and then generate the questions and answers, and henceafter generate the mysql command to add them into the database.
